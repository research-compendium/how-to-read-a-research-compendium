	abstract = {It is important, if not essential, to integrate the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions, simulations, and so on with the documents that describe and rely on them. This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce the results in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, for example, with interactive controls. This article describes a software framework for both authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents---including figures, tables, and so on---can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or “source” document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences.We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them, such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection.The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution, and use of such reproducible research are discussed.},

In this article, we develop these ideas in the context of the ResearchCompendia project.

Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is “reproducibility,” which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

Concretely, we make the case for treating an article as an OSS project following a DevOps approach and applying software engineering best-practices to manage its associated artifacts and maintain the reproducibility of its findings. Popper leverages existing cloud-computing infrastructure and DevOps tools to produce academic articles that are easy to validate and extend. We present a use case that illustrates the usefulness of this approach. We show how, by following the \_Popper\_ convention, reviewers and researchers can quickly get to the point of getting results without relying on the original author's intervention.},

without immediate benefits. In this work, we investigate advantages and new capabilities
of reproducible research papers. Our key contributions are (i) the extension
of a geoscientist’s workflow while examining papers including reproducible figures
such as maps and (ii) the prototypical implementation of the workflow as a web
application. The workflow is based on current practices of geoscientists and encapsulates
benefits of reproducible figures. It is informed by ideas and needs identified
by geoscientists in a survey, interviews, and a focus group. Based on their statements,
we first extend the traditional workflow steps Discovery and Inspection by
additional capabilities and propose two new steps: Manipulation of the content of
a spatio-temporal figure and Substitution of the underlying code and data. The extended
workflow and its implementation might facilitate in-depth examination and
reusability of geoscientific results.},

	abstract = {Reproducible research---by its many names---has come to be regarded as a key concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

	abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

The Whole Tale project aims to address these barriers by connecting computational, data-intensive research efforts with the larger research process—transforming the knowledge discovery and dissemination process into one where data products are united with research articles to create “living publications” or tales. The Whole Tale focuses on the full spectrum of science, empowering users in the long tail of science, and power users with demands for access to big data and compute resources.

Binder provides anyone in the community the opportunity to examine a machine learning pipeline, promoting fairness, accountability, and transparency. Binder is used to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users, enabling the user to build and register a Docker image from a repository and connect with JupyterHub. Users can select a specific branch name, commit, or tag to serve. Binder combines two projects: JupyterHub, which provides a scalable system for authenticating users and launching Jupyter Notebook servers, and repo2docker, which generates a Docker image from a Git repository. When connected with JupyterLab, users can navigate a repository on Binder with an IDE as if they were developing the project locally and can explore all underlying data (CSV, JSON, image, etc.). JupyterHub, repo2docker, and JupyterLab work together on Binder to allow a user to evaluate a machine learning pipeline with much greater transparency than a typical publication or GitHub page. Together, these three projects promote fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning.},
